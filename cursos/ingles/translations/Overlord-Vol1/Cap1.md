# The girl squeezed her eyes tightly shut and bit her lower lip. She had never asked for this. She had been forced into her present circumstances. If only she had some strength, she might have resisted the enemy in front of her and fled.

# However - the girl did not have that strength.
<!-- -->

# Thus, there could only be one outcome to this situation
<!-- -->

# That would be the girl's death, at this very place.
<!-- -->

# The longsword fell -
<!-- -->

# - and yet there was no pain.
<!-- -->

# The girl gingerly opened the eyes which had been squeezed shut.
<!-- -->

# The first thing she saw was the suddenly motionless longsword.
<!-- -->

# Then, she saw the sword's owner.
