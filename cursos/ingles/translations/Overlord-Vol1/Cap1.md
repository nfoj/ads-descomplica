<!-- Overlord - Volume 1 - Prólogo e Capítulo 1 -->

Prologue
<!-- Prólogo -->

The knight in full plate armor stood before the girl and her little sister, his sword raised high.
<!-- O cavaleiro, vestido com armadura completa, parou diante da garota e de sua irmãzinha, com sua espada levantada alto. -->

His blade gleamed in the sin, and he poised himself, ready to end the their lives in a single merciful stroke.
<!-- Sua lâmina brilhava ao sol, e ele se posicionou, pronto para acabar com suas vidas em um único golpe misericordioso. -->

The girl squeezed her eyes tightly shut and bit her lower lip. She had never asked for this. She had been forced into her present circumstances. If only she had some strength, she might have resisted the enemy in front of her and fled.
<!-- A garota apertou os olhos com força e mordeu o lábio inferior. Ela nunca havia pedido por isso. Fora forçada a suas circunstâncias atuais. Se ao menos tivesse um pouco de força, talvez pudesse ter resistido ao inimigo à sua frente e fugido. -->

However - the girl did not have the strength.
<!-- No entanto, a garota não tinha força. -->

Thus, there could only be one outcome to this situation.
<!-- Assim, só poderia haver um resultado para essa situação. -->

That would be the girl's death, at this very place.
<!-- Isso seria a morte da garota, neste exato lugar. -->

The longsword fell-
<!-- A espada longa caiu— -->

-and yet there was no pain.
<!-- —e ainda assim não havia dor. -->

The girl gingerly opened the eyes witch had been squeezed shut. 
<!-- A garota abriu cuidadosamente os olhos que haviam estado fechados. -->

The first thing she saw was the suddenly motionless longsword.
<!-- A primeira coisa que ela viu foi a espada longa, que de repente estava imóvel. -->

Then, she saw the sword's owner
<!-- Então, ela viu o dono da espada. -->

The knight in front of her was frozen in place, his eyes looking somewhere off to the girl's side. His completely defenseless posture clearly displayed the fear that filled him.
<!-- O cavaleiro à sua frente estava congelado no lugar, com os olhos voltados para algum ponto ao lado da garota. Sua postura completamente indefesa mostrava claramente o medo que o dominava. -->

As though drawn by the knight's gaze, the girl could not help but turn and look in the same direction as him.

And so - the girl gazed upon despair.

What she saw was darkness.

It was an infinitesimally thin, yet unfathomably deep blckness. It was a half-oval of obsidian that seemed to protrude from the earth. It was a mysterious sight that filled the ones watching it with a powerfull sense of unease

Was it a door?

The girl could not help but think so after she saw what lay before her.

As her heart luched, the girl's conjecture was confirmed.

Something seemed to be comming out of that shadowy passage.

And in the moment that it resolved itself in her eyes- 

"Hiiiiiiiii!"

-a deafening shriek came from the girl.

It was an opponent which humanity could not overcome.

Twin points of crimson light burned brightl within the empty eye sockets of a bleached sknull. Those two points of light coldly scanned the girl and the others present, like a predator sizing up its prey. Within its fleshless hands it grasped a magic staff that seemed divine in nature, yet inspired dread in equal measure.

It was like a crystallization of all the beauty in the world.

It wore an intricately detailed black robe, and it resembled nothing so much as an incarnation of death, born from the darkness of another world.

In an instant, the air seemed to freeze.

It was as though time itself had stood still in the wake of a Supreme Being's advent.

The girl forgot to breathe, as if the sight had stolen her soul away.

Then, in this silent realm, the girl began choking, and gasped for air.

This avatar of death must have manifested itself in order to guide her to the land of the dead. It was only natural to think so. But then, the girl who thought this way suddenly realized that something was wrong. That was because the knight who had beem planning to kill her from behind was now completely still.

"Gaaaah..."

A cry that sounded like a wail crept into her ears. 

From whose mouth had that sound come? It felt like it could have come from hers, or that of her little sister, shivering in fright, or from the mouth of the knight that had been about to kill her. 

A skeletal hand slowly extended itself - its fingers spreading as though reaching for something, and they mopved past the girl, toward the knight behind her.

She wanted to look away from it, but fear kept her gaze in place. She had the feeling that if she averted her eyes, she would see a far more horrible sight instead.

" [Grasp Heart] ."

The incarnation of death clenched its fist, and the girl heard the sound of crunching metal from behind her.

Though she was afraid to take her eyes away from the figure of death, curiosity got the better of her and the girl wrenched her eyes away, whereupon saw the body of the knight. He was sprawled motionless on the ground, like a puppet whose strings had been cut.

He was dead.

There was no doubt that he was dead.

The danger that had almost claimed the girl was no more. But this was no cause for celebration. The death that stalked hed merely taken a more concrete shape.

That death drew close to the girl, who watched it with terrified eyes.

The darkness in her field of vision grew ever larger.

It's goind to swallow me up.

As the girl thought this, she clutched her sister tightly to herself

The notion of escape no longer existed within the girl's head.

If her opponent were human, she might be able to cling to some faint hope and struggle desperately for her life. But the being before her shattered that hope like spun glass.

Please, at least let me die without pain.

That was all the girl could hope for.

Her shuddering sister hugged her  tightly. All she could do was apologize for her weakness, for being unable to protect her sister's life. She prayed that her sister would not be lonely as they went on to the afterlife, because they would be travelling there together. 

And then -

The End and the Beginning

Part 1

In the year 2138 AD there was a term: DMMo-RPG.

That word was an acreonym for "Dive Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game".

These games were played by connecting a dedicated console to the brain via a neuronal nano-interface - an intracerebral nanocomputer network, created from the fusion of cyber- and nanotechnology.

These were games that allowed one to enter a virtual world and experience it as though it were real life.

And among the myriad DMMO-RPGs that thronged the market, one of them stood head and shoulders above the others:

YGGDRASIL.

Thos game had been painstakingly developed and released twelve years ago, in 2126.

Compared to other DMMO-RPGs of the time, YGGDDRASIL's selling point was "player freedom".

It had over two thousand basic and advanced job classes.

Every class had a maximum of fifteen level, and so in order to reach the overall level cap of one hundred, one would need to take at least seven different classes. However, players could take as many classes as thay wanted as long as they met aeach class's prerequisites. A players could even take a hundred classes at level one each, although that was very inefficient. As such, in this system, it was virtually impossible to make identical characters unless one was deliberately trying to do so.

In addition, one could use various creator tools (sold separately) to fully curstomize one's armor, weaponry, flavor text, appearence, and oher cosmetic settings.

A vast playing field awaited its players. There were nine worlds in total: Asgard, Alfheim, Vanaheim, Nidavellir, Midgard, Jotunheim, Niflheim, Helheim, and Muspelheim. 

It boasted a massive world, numerous classes, and freely customizable appearances.

These features ignited the creative spirits of its Japanese players, and spaked what would later be known as a stylistic revolution. So popular was it that whenever the word "DMMO-RPG" was mentioned in Japan, listeners would immediately thing of YGGDRASIL.

- Stilll, all thesse were things of the past now.

A gigantic table carved of gleaming black stone sat in the center of the room, surrounded by forty one luxurious chairs.

However, most of those seats were empty.

Once, every single place had been filled, but now only two were occupied.

One of the seated people was clothed in a magnificent black academic robe, edged in violet and gold. The collar seemed excessively gaudy, but somehow it fit the overall design. 

However, the exposed head was a bare skull. Points of dark red light glowed in its large eye sockets, and behind that skull glowed a halo of black radiance.

The being in the other seat was not human either, merely a mass of a black, sticky substance. Its tar-like surface roiled and writhed continouusly, never staying in the same shape for more than a second.

The former was an Overlord - the highest-ranked of those magic casters who had become undead in order to learn the most potent spells. The latteer was an Elder Black Ooze, which boasted the most powerful corrosive ability of the slime famlies.

One might encounter these monsters in the most dificult dungeons.  Overlords could use powerful spells of the highest tiers of magic, while Elder Black Oozes were dreaded for their ability to degrade weapons and armor.

However, they were not game monsters, but players.

In YGGDRASIL, players could choose their character races from three broad groups; humanoid, demihuman and heteromorphic. 

Humanoids were the basic players type and comprised humans, dwarves, wood elves, and the like. Demihumans tended to be ugly, but possessed superior atributes to humanoids. Examples of demihumans were goblins, beastmen, ogres, and so on. Finally, heteromorphic races had monstrous abilities, but despite their stats being generally higher than those of races, they also prossessed various drawbacks.
