- BIOS: Basic Input/Output System
  The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is an old system that uses a text menu to boot the computer by accessing the first sector of the hard disk (MBR). This method is insufficient for modern systems, which typically adopt a two-step boot process. 

- UEFI: Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
  UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface). Started as EFI in 1998 in Intel. Now the standard. Uses a specific disk partition for boot (EFI System Partition (ESP)) and uses FAT. On Linux it's located on /boot/efi and the files use the .efi extension. You need to register each bootloader.

- PCI: Peripheral Component Interconnect

- USB: Universal Serial Bus
