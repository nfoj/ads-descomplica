# 101.1 Determine and configure hardware settings

- BIOS: Basic Input/Output System
  The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is an old system that uses a text menu to boot the computer by accessing the first sector of the hard disk (MBR). This method is insufficient for modern systems, which typically adopt a two-step boot process. 

- UEFI: Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
  UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface). Started as EFI in 1998 in Intel. Now the standard. Uses a specific disk partition for boot (EFI System Partition (ESP)) and uses FAT. On Linux it's located on /boot/efi and the files use the .efi extension. You need to register each bootloader.

- PCI: Peripheral Component Interconnect

- USB: Universal Serial Bus

|            | A            | B            | B USB 3.0            | C      |
|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------|--------|
| Type       | Type A       | Type B       | Type B USB 3.0       | Type C |
| Type Mine  | Type Mine A  | Type Mine B  |                      |        |
| Type Micro | Type Micro-A | Type Micro-B | Type Micro-B UBS 3.0 |        |

- Sysfs: is a pseudos file system rpovided by the linux kernel that exports informations about various kernels subsystems, hardware devices and asociated device drives.

```
  cd /sys

  cd /dev/

  // bus, cpu, disk, log ..
    
```

- proc: process and informations

```
  cd /proc

  cd 152

  //cpuinfo
  more cpuinfo

  //meminfo
  more meminfo  
  
```

- ls: list 

lsubs: usb list
lspci: list pci connect
lsblk: list disk
lshw: hardware
lsmod: drives 


- lsmod

```
  cd /lib/modules
  
  // rm mod: remove
  // ins mod: install
  // modprobe 
  
```

- Boot: Hardware > Firmware > Software

- Firmware: responsible for verifying and controlling the hardware before system startup.

  Hardware > Firmware > Bootloader > Kernel, Windonws or Unix

- dmesg : infos kernel

- init: inicializing of programs 

```
  whitch init
  // path: /sbin/init or usr/sbin/init
  
```

- Chage runleves/boot targets and shortdown or reboot system
  - Reboot
  - root-user
  - multi-user
  - Networking
  - GUI - Login
  - Webserver .. dnss .. 
  - Reboot

- List-units 

```
  systemctl list-units --type=target

Legend: LOAD   → Reflects whether the unit definition was properly loaded.
        ACTIVE → The high-level unit activation state, i.e. generalization of SUB.
        SUB    → The low-level unit activation state, values depend on unit type.

21 loaded units listed. Pass --all to see loaded but inactive units, too.
To show all installed unit files use 'systemctl list-unit-files'.

  
```

- Rescue Mode
  - rescue: Local file systems are mounted, no networking, and root-user only (maintenance mode)
  - emergency: Only the root file system and in read-only mode, No networking and root-user only(maintenance mode)
  - reboot
  - halt: Stops all processes and halts CPU activities
  - poweroff: Like halt but also sends an ACPI shutdown signal (No lights!)
  

```

  // Acess > root
  //systemctl isolate 
   
  systemctl isolate multi-user // No GUI

  systemctl isolate rescue
  
  systemctl isolate emergency

  systemctl isolate graphical // GUI

  systemctl isolate reboot

- On SysV we were able to define different stages. On a Red Hat-based system we usually had 7:

  0 - Shutdown
  1 - Single-user mode (recovery); Also called S or s
  2 - Multi-user without networking
  3 - Multi-user with networking
  4 - to be customized by the admin
  5 - Multi-user with networking and graphics
  6 - Reboot

- And in Debian based system we had:
  
  0 - Shutdown
  1 - Single-user mode
  2 - Multi-user mode with graphics
  6 - Reboot

```
  // How to find out > sudo
  runlevel
  
  // output
  N 5

  // How to switch the process > sudo
  init 3 

  //
  run level
  
  // output
  3 5

  // stop 3
  telinit 5
  
```

- Configs Init

```
  cd /etc/

  // Paths
  /etc/rc5.d
  /etc/rc3.d

  /usr/lib/systemd/
  /etc/inittab > inittab
  
```

- Stop System

```

  // path halt, shutdown, reboot
  type halt
  type shutdown
  // halt is /usr/sbin/halt


  // help
  systemctl shutdown --help

  // config shutdown // -r: reboot //  10 min
  shutdown -r 10 message

  shutdown -h 23:00 message
    
```

- Message

```

  // message box
  wall <message>


  // message terminal
  mesg <message>
  
```
