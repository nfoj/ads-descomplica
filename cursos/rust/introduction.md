# Rust!

1. Introduction

a. What is Rust?
  
    Rust is a modern systems programming language designed for performance, reliability, and concurrency. It emphasizes safety and control over memory management,
    making it suitable for writing efficient and secure software. Developed by Mozilla Research, Rust has gained popularity for its innovative features such as
    ownership and borrowing system, which helps prevent common programming errors like null pointer dereferencing and data races.

b. Why use Rust?

    Rust is a system programming language that aims to provide memory safety, concurrency, and performance with a focus on zero cost abstractions. It Rust is
    appreciated for the solutions it provides to common programming language issues. Its emphasis on safety, speed, and support for concurrent programming, as
    well as its robust type system, are just a few reasons why developers choose Rust.

c. Memory Safety and Zero-Cost Abstractions;

    Rust is a high-performance system programming language known for its safety features, including memory safety without garbage collection. It supports concurrent
    programming with thread safety and offers zero-cost abstractions for efficient, high-level coding.
